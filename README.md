## Hi there I'm Ollie..

.. and this, it would seem, is my README profile page!

### What you can find on my Github

Mostly Go, some JavaScript. I do a lot my messing, so some of my projects on here aren't finished, and likely won't be.

### About me

- Go (golang) is my thing (6+ years). Vlang.io is interesting me too - I'm tinkering with it ATM.
- I've experience with AWS, GCP and IBM Cloud.
- I was a contract Go Engineer, but then IR35.
- I'd just started a face-2-face Golang training business, but then Covid19.
- I'm now working in Data Engineering with a big UK household name. 
- I'm quite resilient.

### ðŸ’¬  Favourite quotes:
- "If it ain't Go, I don't want to know" - Me, 2019
- "I'm getting too old for this \*hit!"- Sgt Roger Murtaugh, 1987
